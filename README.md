# How to Publish Your JavaScript Library to npm

Welcome to the guide on how to create and share your own JavaScript library! With this tutorial, you will learn step by step how to write, publish, and update your library so that other people can use it.

### Menu of Steps:
1. **Step 1: Prepare Your Package**  
    - Create a folder for your library.
    - Set up your project with npm.
    - Write your libraryâ€™s code.
    - Add details in the `package.json` file.

2. **Step 2: Publish to npm**  
    - Create an npm account.
    - Log in to npm.
    - Publish your library to npm.

3. **Step 3: Verify Installation**  
    - Test if others can install your library.

4. **Step 4: Update Your Package**  
    - Change your version.
    - Publish a new version.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Package

### 1.1 Create a Folder for Your Project
To start, you need to create a new folder (like a box) where all your library files will go. Open your computer's terminal (itâ€™s like a place where you type commands) and type:

```sh
mkdir my-library  # This makes a new folder called 'my-library'
cd my-library     # This opens the folder so you can start working in it
```

Now youâ€™re ready to create your library!

---

### 1.2 Set Up Your Project with npm
npm is like a big store where libraries live. To make your library ready for the store, you need to tell npm about your project. In your terminal, type:

```sh
npm init
```

You will see questions pop up like:
- **Name**: What do you want to call your library? (e.g., "my-library")
- **Version**: What is the first version of your library? (e.g., "1.0.0")
- **Description**: Describe your library in one sentence.

Just press `Enter` after each question. When you're done, npm will create a special file called `package.json` where all your answers are saved.

---

### 1.3 Write Your Library Code
Now itâ€™s time to write the code that does something useful! In the `my-library` folder, create a file called `index.js`. This is where the magic happens.

Write the following code inside `index.js`:

```js
// index.js
module.exports = function() {
    console.log('Hello, world!');  // This prints "Hello, world!" when used
};
```

This is a simple library that says "Hello, world!" when someone uses it.

---

### 1.4 Add Information to `package.json`
Your `package.json` file helps others know what your library does. Here's an example of what it should look like:

```json
{
  "name": "potatoscript",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple JavaScript library",
  "main": "index.js",
  "keywords": [
    "library",
    "npm"
  ],
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Replace `"Your Name"` with your actual name, and save the file. This is important because npm will use this information to show others what your library is about.

---

## Step 2: Publish to npm

### 2.1 Create an npm Account
Before you can publish your library, you need an npm account. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/signup) and sign up for a free account.

---

### 2.2 Log in to npm
Once you have your account, itâ€™s time to log in. In your terminal, type:

```sh
npm login
```

This will ask for:
- **Username**: Type your username from the npm website.
- **Password**: Type your password.
- **Email**: Type your email address.

After logging in, you're ready to publish your library!

---

### 2.3 Publish Your Library
To put your library on npm for the world to use, type this command in your terminal:

```sh
npm publish
```

If everything goes well, your library will be published! Now others can use it by typing `npm install potatoscript`.

---

## Step 3: Verify Installation

After publishing, let's make sure everything works! Try installing your library into a new project:

1. Go to any folder (or make a new one) and open the terminal.
2. Type the following command:

```sh
npm install potatoscript
```

This will install your library so you can use it. You can also type:

```sh
npm i potatoscript
```

If it works, youâ€™ll see that npm has installed your library, and you can use it in your projects!

---

## Step 4: Update Your Package

### 4.1 Update the Version
When you make changes to your library, you need to update the version number. This is how people know youâ€™ve made new changes. In your `package.json` file, change the version number.

For example:
- If you fixed a bug, change the version to `1.0.1`.
- If you added a new feature, change the version to `1.1.0`.
- If you made big changes, change the version to `2.0.0`.

---

### 4.2 Publish a New Version
After updating your version number, run the `npm publish` command again to update your library on npm.

```sh
npm publish
```

Now everyone can use the new version!

---

## Final Tips

- **README file**: Itâ€™s always good to add a `README.md` file to explain what your library does and how to use it.
- **Test your library**: You can use tools like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test your library and make sure it works well.
- **Versioning**: Always remember to update your version number when you make changes!
